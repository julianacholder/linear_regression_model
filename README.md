## Data Analysis

### Correlation Heatmap

The heatmap reveals relationships between features and tuition fees. University Type shows the strongest correlation (-0.45), indicating private universities tend to have higher fees. Mode of Study shows a moderate negative correlation (-0.21), suggesting online programs generally cost less.

### Fee Distribution
